# Not Fade Away

> A self-hosted, always-on, self-healing AI companion you run on your own machine — stays on your **subscription**.

## Why

As of **2026-06-15**, Claude Code's **non-interactive** calls (`headless` / `-p` / Agent SDK) bill into a separate metered "Agent SDK" pool. But **interactive sessions still run on your Pro/Max subscription** — not metered.

This repo shows how to exploit that: run a persistent, self-healing Claude on your own box, reachable from a web UI anywhere, and extend it into a multi-model group chat (multi-version Claude / GPT / Gemini).

## The one rule that makes it free

| Mode | Trigger | Billing |
|---|---|---|
| **Interactive** | real TTY, no `--print`, stdout not redirected | **Subscription** |
| Non-interactive | `-p` / `--print` / piped stdin / redirected stdout / Agent SDK | Metered Agent SDK pool |

→ The "brain" session **must run on a real PTY**. That single constraint drives every design choice below.

## Architecture

- **Brain** — one interactive `claude` session in a **detached tmux** (real PTY → subscription; survives window close & reboot).
- **Channel plugin** — injects inbound messages into the session; the brain replies via a `reply` tool.
- **Web frontend** — WebSocket two-way, optional thinking-trace view; fully self-hosted, slimmed for slow/lossy networks (zero external deps — self-host fonts/JS, precompile, compress).
- **Self-healing** — health watchdog (curl `/health`, respawn) + process supervisor (launchd/systemd, `KeepAlive`+`RunAtLoad`) + **auto-login** (the most-forgotten link) + N-instance rescue mesh (N≥2 for production).
- **File hygiene** — transcripts/buffers/backups grow unbounded (compaction shrinks the *context window*, not the file on disk → slow resume, runtime crashes). Mitigate with a scheduled cleanup (prune buffers, cap rolling history, drop old backups) + periodic transcript archive-and-fresh-session, with continuity carried by external memory.
- **Multi-model group chat** — bridge sessions so they see each other; cap exchanges-per-turn to stop two autonomous agents from ping-ponging. GPT via `codex` CLI, Gemini via `gemini` CLI (each with its own memory/persona file).
- **Remote access** — Cloudflare Tunnel (no port-forward, no exposed home IP) + origin locked to Cloudflare + key-only SSH + app-layer auth.

## Runs on

**Mac mini / any spare Mac / a Linux VPS / Windows (via WSL2).** The only hard requirement is *a terminal where Claude Code can stay resident on a real PTY*.

- **macOS** — launchd for autostart.
- **Linux/VPS** — systemd (`Restart=always`). ⚠️ data-center IPs may get bot-flagged by Claude; verify the IP can log in/chat first.
- **Windows** — run the Linux variant **inside WSL2** (tmux + scripts unchanged, real PTY → subscription); swap launchd for **Task Scheduler**. Native Windows is possible via ConPTY but has no tmux — not recommended.
